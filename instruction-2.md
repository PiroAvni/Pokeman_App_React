# React useEffect Exercises

Practice of the useEffect hook in React

## Organisation

### Duration

Two exercises:

- Exercise #1: 1h
- Exercise #2: 1h

Note that times are approximate and you can decide how much time you spend on each exercise

### Team

Same pairs of the previous day.

## Brief

### Exercise #1

Extend your music app to include useEffect

Requirements are:

- Fetch some data from an API of your choice - ([lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search) or [Bandsintown](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0#/) are two options with no required authentication or key but feel free to use any!)
- Set an interval for something to happen (it doesn't have to involve an API call - how about a background colour that changes every 30 seconds?) and make sure to clear it in a timely manner!

### Exercise #2

Create a Pokemon App using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)

Requirements are: 

- Write a form where users can enter a pokemon name and your app fetches and displays that pokemon's data as you see fit
- When a request hasn't been made yet, show "no pokemon yet, please submit a pokemon!"
- While fetching the pokemon data, show a loading screen
- Display the pokemon data as soon as it arrives

You will need to make use of the `useEffect` hook for this app

## Output

### Exercise #1

Make sure to create a new branch in your music repo and push your changes from this exercise

### Exercise #2

Make sure to create a new repository for your pokemon app and send your repo link to the Slack channel
